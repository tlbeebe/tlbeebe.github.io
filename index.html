    <p>This was our first chassis attempt for our robot, and our first attempt at soldering the potentiometers and photoresistors. </p>

    <h1>What is PID control?</h1>
   	 <p>PID control is a system of managing a feedback loop. 
	    It stands for Proportional, Integral, Derivative.
	    The P value effects the current error. I accounts for past values,
	    and D estimates future trends. The P and I values decrease the 
	    function rise time, while D attenuates it. 
	  </p>
    <h1>What were our final PID values?</h1>
	  <p>
	    We chose a P value of 43, an I value of 0, a D value of .06, and an S of 89.
	    These values worked best for us as they allowed our vehicle
	    to have fast responses to the track without overcorrecting. A relatively 
	    large P value creates a fast reaction time, which limited our need for a large 
	    I value. Our D value was relatively small, as we did not need to attenuate
	    our P and I values by much.
	  </p>
	  
    <h1>How did you adjust Speed and PID for the different tracks?</h1>
   	 <p> We used larger P and D values on frequency sweep track with a low speed, but we  
	     reduced the P and D on the straighter track, as the straighter track required less
	     pathfinding and more speed. The circular track required a balance of the four values.
