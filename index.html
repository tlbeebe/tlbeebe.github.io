    <h1>What is PID control?</h1>
   	 <p>PID control is a system of managing an output loop. 
	    It stands for Proportional, Integral, Derivative.
	    We chose a P value of XX, an I value of YY, and a D value of ZZ.
	    These values worked best for us due to our long chassis allowing 
	    our vehicle to have fast responses to the track. A small P value
	    creates a fast reaction time, which limited our need for a large 
	    I value. Our D value was also small, as we did not need to attenuate
	    our small P and I values by much.
	  </p>
	  
    <h1>How did you adjust Speed and PID for the different tracks?</h1>
   	 <p> We'll discuss that here when we need to.
